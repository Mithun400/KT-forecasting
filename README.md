# KT-forecasting

Forecasting for head and tail clusters are done by LSTM and Statistical based models. Two notebooks are uploaded here. 
One for the [head cluster notebook](https://github.com/Mithun400/KT-forecasting/blob/main/head_noFE.ipynb) and 
other for the [tail cluster notebook](https://github.com/Mithun400/KT-forecasting/blob/main/Tail50-noFE.ipynb).
